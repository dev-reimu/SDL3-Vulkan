# What is this project?
A robust and efficient SDL3 program that ties in with the Vulkan rendering API, written in the C language.

It aims to support multiple platforms and environments, while boasting a simple structure and being easy to understand.

---
# How does it work?
The program starts with the file `initialize.c`, found in `/src/sdl/`. To understand its significance, as well as that of the other files found in that folder, open the following link and scroll down until you see "Main callbacks in SDL3": https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-main-functions. To put it simply, this program follows an optional structure provided by the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) project. This structure enables more control to the operating system.
